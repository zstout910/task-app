PROJECT #3
----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK-APP
Zach Stout
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Todo list app for tracking task.
I created this project using React.
In the project there is a create list button,
that creates a todo list with checkboxes that
track progress. When all the checkboxes are checked
the list is marked as completed.
You can filter the list to only include completed,
uncompleted, and all.
There is a contact us page listed in the code as profile.
The original idea was to include a profile page, but 
that was later changed.
There is also a delete button to remove unwanted list.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The contact us page does not send a email, it only
console logs the info.
